# Example

This is an example of how to use `Ligen` to generate bindings from `Rust` to other languages.

# How it works

In this example, the binding generator is toggled by the `bindings` feature.

Running `cargo build --features=bindings` will generate all the supported generators.

Check `build.rs` to see which generators are being used.
