# Ligen Editor

Ligen Editor is a Rust-based code editor designed specifically for working with Ligen IR. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for:

* Parsing librarys to Ligen IR
* Saving and loading IRs
* Getting metrics of the parsed IR
* Generating language bindings

Everything that the Editor does can also be done programmatically by using the Ligen library.

### Running Ligen Editor

`$ git clone https://github.com/sensorial-systems/ligen`
`$ cd ligen`
`$ cargo run -p ligen-editor`

<!-- TODO: Publish Ligen Editor and instruct to use `cargo install ligen-editor` instead -->
